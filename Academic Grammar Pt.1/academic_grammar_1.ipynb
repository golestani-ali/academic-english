    "\n",
    "<center><h4>A description of the grammar of a language gives an account of the sentence structures\n",
    "that are <ins>possible</ins> in that language.<br> It will identify certain grammatical <ins>units</ins>\n",
    "smaller than the sentence and give rules to explain how these are <ins>combined</ins> to make\n",
    "sentences.</h4></center>\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Form Identification</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many grammatical descriptions present a hierarchy of units, in which\n",
    "* a <ins>sentence</ins> (at the top of the hierarchy) consists of\n",
    "* one or more <ins>clauses</ins>, which consist of\n",
    "* one or more <ins>phrases</ins>, which consist of\n",
    "* one or more <ins>words</ins>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1.1, demonstrates this hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>(example 1.1)</b><br> <img src=\"images/image.png\" width=\"800px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each type of unit can be <t style=\"color:yellow\">categorised</t> and <t style=\"color:yellow\">labelled</t>, and the labels tell us something about the potential the units have for appearing in <ins>higher-level</ins> units.\n",
    "\n",
    "<t style=\"color:yellow\">Words</t> are typically grouped using <ins>word class labels</ins> such as noun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, determiner and conjunction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<t style=\"color:yellow\">Phrases</t> can be categorised according to their </ins>central component</ins> (head) into noun phrases, verb phrases, adjective phrases, adverb phrases, and prepositional phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<t style=\"color:yellow\">Clauses</t> can be divided into <ins>main</ins> (independent) and <ins>subordinate</ins> (dependent) clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "So an analysis of the same sentence, using such labels would be:\n",
    "\n",

    "<h4>Embedding Feature</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "* The components of phrases may themselves be phrases or clauses, and the components of clauses may themselves be clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the prep-ositional phrase ‘at the bottom of the garden’ has the prepositional phrase ‘of the garden’ embedded within it, and ‘boy who was playing football is called Jack’ can be said to have the clause ‘who was playing football’ embedded within it.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Function Identification</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many grammatical descriptions go on to categorise the elements of clauses according to their <ins>grammatical function</ins>, using labels such as subject, verb, object, complement and adverbial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1.3, identifies grammatical units according to their grammatical function:\n",
    "\n",
    "> <b>(example 1.3)</b><br> <img src=\"images/function.png\" width=\"800px\">\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is often – but not always – a correspondence between certain grammatical units and elements having particular grammatical functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "* the verb element is always realised by a verb phrase.\n",
    "* the subject element is usually realised by a noun phrase but may be realised by a clause (e.g. What I want to know is where he gets his money from);\n",
    "* an adverbial is often realised by an adverb phrase but may be realised by a noun phrase (e.g. She slept all day), prepositional phrase (e.g. She went out in the evening) or clause (e.g. She went to bed feeling rather ill).\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Firm Structure is not always the best answer</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of difficulties with firm structures we have defined above. One is that in unprepared speech, such as\n",
    "most conversation, we do not speak in well-formed sentences.<br>\n",
    "If we take a transcription of spoken language, it would be difficult to consistently insert sentence-final punctuation marks.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>In conversation, then, the sentence seems to be problematic as the fundamental grammatical unit. In written text, too, there may be difficulties.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to difficulties such as these, some grammatical descriptions <t style=\"color:red\">reject</t> the sentence as the main unit of analysis and focus instead on the <ins>clause</ins>, usually defined as a group of words having a central (and necessary) verb together with any associated subject, object(s), complement(s) and adverbial(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition of the clause certainly seems to be less problematic than definition of the sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Clauses are often classified according to mood as follows:\n",
